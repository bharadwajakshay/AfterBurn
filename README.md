This source code is for an Wear OS app that calculates the statistics displayed on Orange theory fitness center's displays.
Orange theory is quite popular in US and they use an heart rate monitior to read your heart rate and put you in one of the 5 zones based on your heart rate. The heart rate monitor has to be purchased for $100.00 and does nothing other than monitor the bpm. This is redundant when you already have a smart watch which can read your heart rate pretty accurately 

So this is my attempt to calculate the statistics on an WearOs smart watch. This app is being developed and tested on Fossil Gen 4 SmartWatch.
